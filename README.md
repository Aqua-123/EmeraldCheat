# EmeraldCheat

It's a cheat for EmeraldChat! Specifically, it's a full UI replacement for emeraldchat.com that tries its best to be more stable, provide users with more information and allow them to use the browser's navigation instead of being one big and horrible single-page app.

## I want to use this

1. Install some user script manager for your browser like Tampermonkey
2. Open and install: [https://undateable.net/files/@asya/emeraldcheat.user.js](https://undateable.net/files/@asya/emeraldcheat.user.js)

## I want to build this
Building requires the "filmer" application which I can provide you with upon request because it needs to be built for your system.

## I want to contribute to this
Contributions are very welcome, sorry for spaghetti :(
